    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the final project is for you to create a **digital analytical edition** of a corpus using the tools, practices, and perspectives you’ve learning in this course. You will select a corpus that has already been digitized and transcribed, parse that into an F-compliant set of tables, and then generate and visualize the results of a series of fitted models. You will also draw some tentative conclusions regarding the linguistic, cultural, psychological, or historical features represented by your corpus. The point of the exercise is to have you work with a corpus through the entire pipeline from ingestion to interpretation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you will acquire a collection of long-form texts and perform the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Convert** the collection from their source formats (F0) into a set of tables that conform to the Standard Text Analytic Data Model (F2).\n",
    "- **Annotate** these tables with statistical and linguistic features using NLP libraries such as NLTK (F3).\n",
    "- **Produce** a vector representation of the corpus to generate TFIDF values to add to the TOKEN (aka CORPUS) and VOCAB tables (F4).\n",
    "- **Model** the annotated and vectorized model with tables and features derived from the application of unsupervised methods, including PCA, LDA, and word2vec (F5).\n",
    "- **Explore** your results using statistical and visual methods.\n",
    "- **Present** conclusions about patterns observed in the corpus by means of these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are finished, you will make the results of your work available in GitHub (for code) and UVA Box (for data). You will submit to Gradescope (via Canvas) a PDF version of a Jupyter notebook that contains the information listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Some Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please fill out your answers in each task below by editing the markdown cell. \n",
    "- Replace text that asks you to insert something with the thing, i.e. replace `(INSERT IMAGE HERE)` with an image element, e.g. `![](image.png)`.\n",
    "- For URLs, just paste the raw URL directly into the text area. Don't worry about providing link labels using `[label](link)`.\n",
    "- Please do not alter the structure of the document or cell, i.e. the bulleted lists. \n",
    "- You may add explanatory paragraphs below the bulleted lists.\n",
    "- Please name your tables as they are named in each task below.\n",
    "- Tasks are indicated by headers with point values in parentheses."

T017 is at the very positive end of component 0, and T04 is at the very positive end of component 1. These topics both are colored blue, meaning that they are most prevalent in the work of Taylor Swift. This to me indicates that Taylor Swift's work is distinct from the other artists in some way that can easily be represented through the topics, or that her work is overwhelming the algorithm, as she is the most prevalent artist. The topics are also only dominated by 5 artists, Taylor Swift, Drake, Eminem, Kanye West, and Beyonce, which could indicate that their work is most influential within the datset."
